This repository can help you to generate a ground-truth of the objects in the CHAIRS dataset. It also provides our clear and verified inference to the unknown information in the dataset.

**infer.py** : About how we infer the labels corresponding to parts of the chairs.

**frame_statics.py**: To generate frame info for each object.

**transform.py**: To transform parts of the chairs with its corresponding translation and rotation.

**test.py**: To combine parts of the chair into an intact one.

赶时间可以考虑晚一年发，而不是把所有东西全都揉在一块让使用的人理解100%的内容之后解决90%的问题。
